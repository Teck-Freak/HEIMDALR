# HEIMDALR

Heimdalr guards the Bifr√∂st, the rainbow-bridge between Asgard (the ralm of the higher norse gods) and the rest of the nine ralms.
In a simmilar fashion, this software guards the bridge between a model and its simulations.

HEIMDALR stands for "House Energy Intake Model for Displays Analysis Lightmaps & Renderings".
It is a suite of tools for fast and for detailed simulations of buildings in regard to
Heating, Cooling, Ventilation, Air-Conditioning, Lighting, Airflow and Electricity demands.
Results will be viewed in colored heatmaps, displacements or our very own floor-plan plots.

Keep in mind, HEIMDALR is still in early development. Once completed it shall have ist watchfull eyes on:
    Heating (and cooling)
    Electricity
    Infiltration (and ventilation)
    Materials (design and amounts)
    Districts & Distribution (as in district heating, etc.)
    Accoustics
    Lighting and
    Renderings

Further it is planned to allow for switchable simulation backends and to be portable.
